Installation
--------------

The installation process is broken down into two distinct steps:

* Setup
* Configuration

### Setting up your helpdesk project

In this step of the installation process, you'll be downloading the helpdesk project skeleton and installing all of its dependent components.

As per your convenience, you can choose to either use composer for download the project and install all its dependencies automatically or directly download the project archive that comes pre-packaged with all of the project dependencies already installed.

We recommend using composer over direct download whenever possible. However, if your system does not have enough ram to execute composer operations properly (for example: installing on a shared host with limited system resources), we suggest using the direct download method instead to mitigate these kind of issues.

Irrespective of the method you use, the process to configuring your helpdesk remains the same.

#### Composer

You can use composer to setup your project by simply running the following command from your terminal:

```bash
$ composer create-project uvdesk/community-skeleton helpdesk-project
```

#### Direct Download

Alternatively, you can also [download the zip archive](https://cdn.uvdesk.com/uvdesk/downloads/opensource/uvdesk-community-current-stable.zip) of the latest stable release and extract its content by running the following commands from your terminal:

```bash
$ wget "https://cdn.uvdesk.com/uvdesk/downloads/opensource/uvdesk-community-current-stable.zip" -P /var/www/
$ unzip -q /var/www/uvdesk-community-current-stable.zip -d /var/www/ \
```

### Configuring your helpdesk project

After you've downloaded and installed all the project dependencies, you can configure your helpdesk installation using either of the following ways:

#### Using Terminal

```bash
$ php bin/console uvdesk:configure-helpdesk
```

#### Using Web Installer Wizard

##### Extract the contents of zip and execute the project in your browser in case of project zip download:

~~~
http(s)://localhost/community-skeleton/public
~~~

##### In case of created project using command, execute the project in your browser:

~~~
http(s)://localhost/helpdesk-project/public
~~~

or

~~~
http(s)://example.com/public
~~~

After opening your project in the web browser, you will be greeted by the web installer which will guide you in configuring your project.


##### Run project on localhost (dev mode)
```bash
php bin/console server:run
```

**How to clear cache:**

```bash
php bin/console c:c
```

**How to log in as admin/agent:**

*Below url is the default url for admin/agent login if you have not made any changes for /member prefix.*

> *http(s)://example.com/en/member/login* 

**How to log in as customer:**

*Below url is the default url for customer login if you have not made any changes for /customer prefix.*

> *http(s)://example.com/en/customer/login*
